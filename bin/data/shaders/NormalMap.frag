Tangent space normal mapping shader for a single directional light source.

The tangent vector is passed to the vertex shader in gl_MultiTexCoord1. The
tangent vector is assumed to be a four component vector. The tangent vector's
w component indicates the handedness of the local tangent space at this vertex.
The handedness is used to calculate the bitangent vector. The reason for the
inclusion of the handedness component is to allow for triangles with mirrored
texture mappings.

The vertex shader transforms the lightDir and halfVector vectors into tangent
space using the rotation matrix:

                  [ tangent.x    tangent.y    tangent.z   ]
    tbnMatrix  =  [ bitangent.x  bitangent.y  bitangent.z ]
                  [ normal.x     normal.y     normal.z    ]

Since GLSL matrices are column-major the tbnMatrix is declared as

    mat3 tbnMatrix = mat3(tangent.x, bitangent.x, normal.x,
                          tangent.y, bitangent.y, normal.y,
                          tangent.z, bitangent.z, normal.z);

and using this matrix we can transform vectors into tangent space as follows:
    
    vec3 lightDir = tbnMatrix * gl_LightSource[0].position.xyz;
    
The fragment shader performs standard Blinn-Phong per fragment lighting. The
only thing different is we read the normal from the normal map texture rather
than using an interpolated vertex normal. Prior to being stored in the normal
map texture the normals are in the range [-1,1]. Once stored in the normal map
texture the normals will be compressed to the range [0,255]. When the normals
are accessed from the fragment shader GLSL will remap then to the range [0,1].
To convert the normals back to the original [-1,1] range we need to perform a
scale and a bias. We do this by:
    
    vec3 n = texture2D(normalMap, gl_TexCoord[0].st).xyz * 2.0 - 1.0;

We don't have to worry about transforming any vectors into tangent space in the
fragment shader because we have already done this in the vertex shader.
